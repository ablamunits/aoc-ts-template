# AoC 2021

For each new Advent of Code puzzle, you can get started quickly by cloning a solution template into a new directory.

For example, if this is Day 2 of Advent of Code, follow these steps:

- Run `yarn clone day2` to clone the solution template and files into `src/day2`.
- Paste your new puzzle input into `input.ts`
- Code your solutionin `solution.ts`
- Use `spec.ts` to test your solution against the example input of each puzzle.
- Solve for your unique puzzle input by running `yarn solve day2`

You can also run `yarn solve:watch day2` to watch for changes in your solution file.

Ofcourse, in the steps above remember to use `day{THE_CURRENT_DAY}`. 

Have fun!
